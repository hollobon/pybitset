Based on Objects/setobject.c in the Python distribution.


Pybitset provides a Python extension module (bitset) which implements
a fast, small set class (Bitset) for integers in the range [1..32]. A
32 bit integer is used internally to store the set, allowing bitwise
operators to be used for the usual set operations, in constant time.

Most operations are appreciably faster than using Python's built in set.

All the methods and operators provided by set are implemented, with
the obvious caveat that they can only handle other Bitsets or
iterables yielding integers 1 <= x <= 32.

It requires Python 2.6 or higher.

Installation:

python ./setup.py install
